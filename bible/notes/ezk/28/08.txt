===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the ruler of Tyre.
  * **Will you truly say, “I am a god”** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that it would be foolish to tell the person who is about to kill you that you are a god. AT: "You will not dare to say "I am a god." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **to the face of one** - "in front of the person" or "while looking at the face of the person"
  * **You are a man and not God, and you will be in the hand of the one who pierces you** - "When the one who pierces you has control over you, it will be very clear that you are a man and not a god"
  * **You will die the death of the uncircumcised** - The people of Tyre practiced circumcision and despised those who were not circumcised. AT: "You will die in disgraceful way."
  * **by the hand of foreigners** - "foreigners will kill you"
  * **This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[:kn:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]].
