===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:kn:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

Moses describes the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.

These verses end Moses' song.

  * **Rejoice, you nations **- Moses addresses the nations as if they were physically present. (See: [[:kn:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **for he will avenge the blood of his servants and he will render vengeance on his enemies - **  AT: "for he will take revenge for the death of his servants and he will take revenge on his enemies"
