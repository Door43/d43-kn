===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues to describe the time when God will save the people of Israel. Although these events would happen in the future, Isaiah describes them as if they already happened. This emphasizes that they certainly will happen. (See: [[kn:bible:notes:isa:09:01|9:1-2]])
  * **For to us a child has been born, to us a son has been given** - AT: "For the Lord will give to us a child."  (See: [[kn:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[kn:bible:team-info:training:topics:grammar:inclusive]] and [[kn:bible:team-info:training:topics:grammar:active]]).
  * **the rule will be on his shoulder** - "The son will rule the people" 
  * **to establish it and sustain it with justice and with righteousness** - This can be translated as a new sentence: "He will establish and protect his kingdom and he will do what is fair and just"
  * **Yahweh of Hosts** - See how you translated this in [[kn:bible:notes:isa:01:09|1:9]].
