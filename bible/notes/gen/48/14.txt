\v 14 Israel reached out with his right hand and laid it upon Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head. He crossed his hands, for Manasseh was the firstborn.
\v 15 Israel blessed Joseph, saying, 
\q "The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, 
\q the God who has cared for me to this day,
\q
\v 16 the angel who has protected me from all harm, may he bless these boys.  
\q May my name be named in them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac. 
\q May they grow into a multitude on the earth."
