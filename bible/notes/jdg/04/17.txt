\v 17 But Sisera ran away on foot to the tent of Jael (the wife of Heber the Kenite), for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor, and the house of Heber (the Kenite).
\v 18 Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Turn aside, my lord; turn aside to me and do not be afraid.” So he turned aside to her and came into her tent, and she covered him with a blanket.
