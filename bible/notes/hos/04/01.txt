===== Translation Notes: =====

This chapter begins Yahweh's presentation of his case against the unfaithful Israelites.

  * **lawsuit**  - a complaint by one person against another in a court of law
  * **no knowledge of God in the land **- This means that the Israelites are acting as if they have no knowledge of what they should be doing to obey and worship Yahweh.
  * **The people have broken all bounds, and bloodshed comes after bloodshed. **- //The people have broken all bounds, and bloodshed comes after bloodshed //  can be made explicit: "You have broken every law, and you commit one murder after another."
